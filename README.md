# mcfexifdates

This script helps you in creating a Cewe Fotobuch project (`*.mcf` files).
It parses an existing project and prints the dates of the images on each
page.

This allows you to manually add date annotations to your project
or simply match pictures on pages to certain events.

Digging through the pictures on each page with the Cewe Fotobuch editor
is a bit cumbersome, so this script does this for you.
